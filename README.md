# basic-dice-game

### Introduction
I've built this dice game project when I was practising learning DOM and coding with JavaScript. 

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### How this dice game works?
There are 6 dice images named 1 to 6. I've generated a variable storing a random variable to match the dice images. Then manipulated HTML elements according to game result.
